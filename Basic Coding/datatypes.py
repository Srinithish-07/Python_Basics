    DataTypes in python
        1. None
        
        2. Numeric:-
            -> int  10
            -> float  17.8 
            -> complex  6+5j
            -> bool  True or False

        3. Sequence:-
            -> list  [1,2,3,4,1,5] mutable and more methods available (ordered)
            -> tuple (1,2,3,4,1,5) immutable and less methods avalaible (ordered)
            -> sets  {1,2,3,4,5} same as like lists but only unique elements allowed
            -> string name = "Nithish"
            -> range

        3. Mapping:-
            -> dictionary {1:'Csk' , 2:'Mi' , 3:'Rcb'} same like sets but accessed using keys of the values


    Operators:-
        1.Arithmetic Operators:
            -> + (Addition)
            -> - (Subtraction)
            -> * (Multiplication)
            -> / (Division)
            -> % (Modulus)
            -> // (Floor Division)
            -> ** (Exponentiation)

        2.Comparison Operators:
            -> == (Equal to)
            -> != (Not equal to)
            -> < (Less than)
            -> > (Greater than)
            -> <= (Less than or equal to)
            -> >= (Greater than or equal to)

        3.Logical Operators:
            -> and (Logical AND)
            -> or (Logical OR)
            -> not (Logical NOT)

        4.Assignment Operators:
            -> = (Assignment)
            -> += (Addition assignment)
            -> -= (Subtraction assignment)
            -> *= (Multiplication assignment)
            -> /= (Division assignment)
            -> %= (Modulus assignment)
            -> //= (Floor division assignment)
            -> **= (Exponentiation assignment)

        5..Bitwise Operators:
            -> & (Bitwise AND)
            -> | (Bitwise OR)
            -> ^ (Bitwise XOR)
            -> ~ (Bitwise NOT)
            -> << (Left shift)
            -> >> (Right shift)
